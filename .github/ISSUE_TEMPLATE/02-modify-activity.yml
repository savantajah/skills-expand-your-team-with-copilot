        ## üí° Implementation Hints for Copilot Agent
        
        **Files to modify:**
        - `src/backend/database.py` - Update the specific activity in `initial_activities` dictionary
        - May need to update frontend if schedule format changes significantly
        
        **Important considerations:**
        - Preserve existing participant registrations unless capacity is reduced
        - Update both the human-readable schedule string and schedule_details object
        - If reducing max_participants, handle the case where current participants exceed new limit
        - Test that all existing functionality still works after changes
        
        **Data structure to update:**
        ```python
        "Activity Name": {
            "description": "Updated description",
            "schedule": "Updated human readable schedule",
            "schedule_details": {
                "days": ["Updated", "Days"],
                "start_time": "HH:MM",
                "end_time": "HH:MM"
            },
            "max_participants": updated_number,
            "participants": [existing_participants]  # Preserve unless capacity issues
        }
        ```
        
        **Testing checklist:**
        - Verify changes appear correctly on website
        - Check existing registrations are preserved
        - Test new schedule displays properly
        - Confirm registration functionality still works
