        ## üí° Implementation Hints for Copilot Agent
        
        **Files to modify:**
        - `src/backend/database.py` - Remove the activity from `initial_activities` dictionary
        - Check if frontend code has any hardcoded references that need updating
        
        **Important considerations:**
        - This is a destructive operation - double-check the activity name
        - Remove the entire activity entry from the database initialization
        - Consider if any frontend code specifically references this activity
        - Verify the activity name exactly matches what's in the code
        
        **Data structure to remove:**
        Remove the entire activity object from `initial_activities`:
        ```python
        # Remove this entire block:
        "Activity Name": {
            "description": "...",
            "schedule": "...",
            "schedule_details": {...},
            "max_participants": ...,
            "participants": [...]
        }
        ```
        
        **Testing checklist:**
        - Verify activity no longer appears on website
        - Confirm no errors when loading activities page
        - Check that other activities still work normally
        - Test that removed activity name cannot be used for registration
        
        **‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Note:**
        This is a permanent removal. Make sure the activity name is exactly correct and the removal is truly intended.
