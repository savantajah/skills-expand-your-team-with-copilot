        ## ðŸ’¡ Debugging Hints for Copilot Agent
        
        **Registration system components to check:**
        
        **Backend registration logic:**
        - `src/backend/routers/activities.py` - `signup_for_activity()` and `unregister_from_activity()` functions
        - Check authentication verification
        - Verify database update operations
        - Confirm participant list management
        
        **Frontend registration handling:**
        - `src/static/app.js` - Form submission handlers for signup/unregister
        - Check API call formatting and error handling
        - Verify UI updates after registration actions
        
        **Common registration issues:**
        1. **Authentication failures** - Check teacher login validation
        2. **Database update failures** - Verify MongoDB operations work
        3. **Capacity checking** - Ensure participant limits are enforced correctly
        4. **Email validation** - Check student email format validation
        5. **UI sync issues** - Verify frontend refreshes after backend changes
        
        **Files to investigate:**
        - `src/backend/routers/activities.py` - Main registration logic
        - `src/backend/database.py` - Data persistence and participant management
        - `src/static/app.js` - Frontend registration forms and API calls
        - `src/backend/routers/auth.py` - Teacher authentication verification
        
        **Testing checklist:**
        - Test registration with valid teacher account
        - Test registration with invalid/no authentication
        - Test registration when activity is at capacity
        - Test unregistration functionality
        - Verify participant list updates correctly
        - Check error messages are helpful and accurate
        
        **Data verification:**
        - Check that participant arrays are properly updated in the database
        - Verify capacity limits are respected
        - Confirm registration status reflects in the UI accurately
