        ## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Hints for Copilot Agent
        
        **Development approach:**
        1. **Analyze requirements** - Break down the feature into specific functional requirements
        2. **Design approach** - Consider how this fits with existing architecture
        3. **Identify files to modify** - Determine backend and frontend changes needed
        4. **Plan implementation** - Start with minimal viable version, then enhance
        5. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure new feature doesn't break existing functionality
        
        **Common implementation areas:**
        
        **Backend changes** (if needed):
        - `src/backend/routers/` - New API endpoints
        - `src/backend/database.py` - Data model changes
        - New router files for complex features
        
        **Frontend changes** (likely needed):
        - `src/static/index.html` - New UI elements
        - `src/static/app.js` - New JavaScript functionality
        - `src/static/style.css` - Styling for new features
        
        **Feature implementation patterns:**
        - **UI enhancements** - Modify HTML/CSS/JavaScript
        - **New data features** - Add database fields and API endpoints
        - **Workflow improvements** - Update existing functions and add validation
        - **Reporting features** - Create new views and data aggregation
        
        **Testing checklist:**
        - Feature works as described in all scenarios
        - Existing functionality remains unaffected
        - Feature handles edge cases gracefully
        - UI is responsive and accessible
        - Performance impact is acceptable
        
        **Documentation to update:**
        - Update API documentation if new endpoints added
        - Consider updating user guides or help text
