        ## üí° Debugging Hints for Copilot Agent
        
        **Investigation approach:**
        1. **Reproduce the issue** - Follow the exact steps provided
        2. **Check logs** - Look for error messages in browser console or server logs
        3. **Identify root cause** - Trace through the code path that's failing
        4. **Verify fix** - Ensure the fix works and doesn't break other functionality
        
        **Common areas to check:**
        - **Backend API endpoints** (`src/backend/routers/`) - Check for proper error handling
        - **Database operations** (`src/backend/database.py`) - Verify data operations work correctly
        - **Frontend JavaScript** (`src/static/app.js`) - Check for JavaScript errors or logic issues
        - **Authentication** (`src/backend/routers/auth.py`) - Verify login/session handling
        
        **Files likely involved:**
        - `src/backend/routers/activities.py` - Activity registration logic
        - `src/backend/routers/auth.py` - Teacher authentication
        - `src/backend/database.py` - Data storage and retrieval
        - `src/static/app.js` - Frontend behavior and API calls
        - `src/static/index.html` - UI elements and forms
        
        **Testing checklist:**
        - Reproduce the exact issue described
        - Verify the fix resolves the problem
        - Test related functionality hasn't broken
        - Check edge cases and error conditions
        - Confirm the fix works across different browsers if applicable
