        ## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Hints for Copilot Agent
        
        **Files to modify:**
        - `src/backend/database.py` - Add new activity to `initial_activities` dictionary
        - Consider if frontend categorization in `src/static/app.js` needs updates
        
        **Data structure required:**
        ```python
        "Activity Name": {
            "description": "Activity description",
            "schedule": "Human readable schedule string",
            "schedule_details": {
                "days": ["Monday", "Wednesday"],
                "start_time": "HH:MM",
                "end_time": "HH:MM"
            },
            "max_participants": number,
            "participants": []  # Start empty or with initial participants
        }
        ```
        
        **Testing checklist:**
        - Verify activity appears on website
        - Test student registration functionality
        - Check schedule display is correct
        - Confirm participant limits work
